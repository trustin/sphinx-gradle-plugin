sphinx-gradle-plugin
====================
*sphinx-gradle-plugin* is a `Gradle`_ plugin that uses `Sphinx`_ to generate a project web site or
documentation.

Sphinx itself was originally created by the Python community for the new Python documentation. It uses
a plaintext format called `reStructured Text`_ which it then compiles into a variety of documentation formats
such as HTML, LaTeX (for PDF) and ePub. reStructured Text is similar to `Markdown`_ but - at least via Sphinx -
has better support for multi-page documentation.

This plugin reuses the ``SphinxRunner`` implementation of ``sphinx-maven-plugin`` originally written by
`Thomas Dudziak`_. `Bala Sridhar`_ since then upgraded Sphinx to 1.3.1 and added PlantUML
support in his fork. I'd like to appreciate their effort that did all the heavy lifting.
